## Exercises

You will **not** need to create new files in this exercise, you'll work directly in `exercises.py`.  Also, please don't delete other files.

1. (**5 points**) in `exercises.py`, implement the [factorial function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial).  Once you have it done, commit all your changes to `exercises.py` with a message saying "implement factorial function".

2. (**5 points**) in `exercises.py`, implement the `multiples` function.  This function receives a list of numbers called `numbers` and a number called `n` as parameters, and returns a new list with all numbers in `numbers` that are a multiple of `n`. Once you have it done, commit all your changes to `exercises.py` with a message saying "implement multiples function".
